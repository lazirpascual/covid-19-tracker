# Covid-19 Tracker

This is a React application that can help spread awareness about Covid-19 by visualizing data/statistics about the virus. It uses an [external API](https://covid19.mathdro.id/api) to display the the main statistics (number of infected, recovered, deaths) of the virus in over 190+ countries around the globe. The data is displayed in graphs and charts using Charts.js. <br />
